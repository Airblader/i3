i3 - Unofficial Gaps Branch
===========================

This branch uses the gaps patch from:
http://infra.in.zekjur.net/pipermail/i3-discuss/2012-November/001042.html

I have also included some minor fixes that, for me at least, make it work perfectly.

As well as this there is now a litle bit more convinient way to change the gap size by
modifying the GAP_SIZE macros near the top of src/render.c .



And the result:
